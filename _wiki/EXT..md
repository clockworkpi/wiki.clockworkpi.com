![](img/Ext_fig01.webp "Ext_fig01.webp") Introducing the DIY-friendly Ext.

We specially cut the mainboard in half. Half of it is reserved and used
to carry the imagination and possibility of DIY, and this half is called
the "Ext. Module."

Tech Specs:

- 94x77mm size

- Thermal printer interface
- Standard MIPI-CSI (camera interface)
- Two standard USB-A interfaces
- Dual speaker (left and right channel) interface

- 52Pin golden fingers to connect to the mainboard

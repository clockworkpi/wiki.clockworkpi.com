## Powering Up

After you've [assembled](Assembly "wikilink") the GameShell you can turn
the device on using the power button found on the back of the device

If you've assembled the device correctly, the GameShell will go through
an initial boot sequence and you'll be greeted with the Launcher

## Settings

Now that the GameShell is booted up you'll want to go through the
Settings and get a few things set up:

- Connect your GameShell to a **Wi-Fi** network. Note that the wifi
  chipset on the GameShell does not currently support 5GHz bands
- Set the system **Timezone** to your preferred location so that the
  system clock will show the correct time
- Change your preferred **Language**
- Consider the GameShell's gamepad **Button Layout**. The assembly
  instructions use the Xbox controller A/B format. If you plan on
  playing retro games from Nintendo (NES, SNES, Gameboy, GBA, etc.) you
  might want to adjust these settings and reverse the A/B buttons on
  your GameShell

### Danger Zone

If you're new to the GameShell and uncomfortable with Linux systems, I'd
advise against messing with the following settings unless you absolutely
have to:

- Update Launcher - Make sure you check that the GameShell OS is updated
  to the latest GameShell OS *before* you update the launcher. Upgrading
  the GameShell OS cannot yet be done within the launcher. You will need
  to check the [GameShell
  Forums](https://forum.clockworkpi.com/c/gameshell/Firmware/19) for the
  latest OS release announcements and for upgrade instructions.
- Switch to LauncherGo - this is an experimental version of the current
  Launcher written in the Go programming language.
- GPU Driver Switch - gives you the ability to select between the
  default graphics driver (FBTURBO) and the experimental LIMA driver

## Let's Play Some Games!

The GameShell comes with:

- **Independent (indie) game**s that have been built to run on the
  GameShell without any additional software
- **Game Engines** that can run games built using those engines
- **Emulators** that emulate retro gaming consoles

### Independent Games

The GameShell comes with:

- Cave Story
- Planet-Busters
- OpenTyrian
- No.909
- NyanCat
- 2048
- Hurrican
- GSPLauncher

### Game Engines

Game Engines help developers build games across multiple platforms. The
GameShell comes with support for popular game engines such as PICO-8,
LÃ–VE2D, Godot and many more! Some of the game engines that come
pre-installed with the GameShell have games pre-loaded on to them, so
make sure to explore each one!

The full list of compatible game engines are:

### Emulators

The GameShell OS comes pre-installed with lots of open source emulators.
You can think of emulators as apps that can virtually run a retro
console inside your GameShell. Unfortunately the GameShell doesn't come
with retro games for its retro console emulators; so we'll have to do a
bit more work to get things going. You'll need to:

1.  Find the specific retro game ROMs (i.e. game images or game backups)
2.  Upload the ROMs onto to the GameShell
3.  Get playing!

Most of the emulators that you'll be using are installed under the
**Retro Games** folder in the home screen. You can check out the full
list of [supported emulators here](Compatible_emulators "wikilink").
